s:1243:"<p>Database enables participants to create, maintain, and search a collection of entries.</p>

<p>The structure of the entries is defined using different types of fields, such as short text, dropdown list, text area, URL, image, or file.</p>

<p>As a teacher, you can comment and rate entries. You can also allow students to rate and comment on entries (peer evaluation). Ratings can be aggregated to form a final grade, which is recorded in the gradebook.</p>

<p>If the Database auto-linking filter is enabled, any entries in a database will be automatically linked where the words or phrases appear within the course.</p>

<p>You can use Database to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a collaborative collection of links, books, book reviews, journal references, etc.</li>
<li>Display student-created photos, posters, websites or poems for peer comment and review.</li>
</ul>
