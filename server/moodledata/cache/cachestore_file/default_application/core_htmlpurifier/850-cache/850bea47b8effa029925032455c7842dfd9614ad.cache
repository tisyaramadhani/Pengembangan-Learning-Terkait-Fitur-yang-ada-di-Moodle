s:977:"<p>The folder module enables a teacher to display a number of related files inside a single folder, reducing scrolling on the course page. A zipped folder may be uploaded and unzipped for display, or an empty folder created and files uploaded into it.</p>

<p>A folder may be used</p>

<ul>
<li>For a series of files on one topic, for example a set of past examination papers in pdf format or a collection of image files for use in student projects</li>
<li>To provide a shared uploading space for teachers on the course page (keeping the folder hidden so that only teachers can see it)</li>
</ul>
